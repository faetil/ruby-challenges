# Methods

# Write a method called 'in_array' which will take 
# two parameteres:
# One as a string and one as an array of strings

# Return a boolean indicationg whether or not the
# string is found in the array.

# Test your solution with:
# ruby tests/05_in_array_test.rb

# Example:
# "hello", ["hi","howdy","hello"] should return true.
 
def in_array (needle, haystack)
  # Your code here
  #bool = true
 
  #until bool

  

    
     haystack.include?(needle)
   
   end
   
  
#( puts "you are false") 

# haystack = ["hi", "howdy", "hello"]
#   puts "enter stuff"
#   needle = gets.chomp.downcase
#  in_array(needle,haystack)


# Beast Mode:

# Redo the challenge but try solving it again in a different way.
